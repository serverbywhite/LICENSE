PyMaKaizu License v5.7.1 (Non-Commercial Use)

The following tools are covered under this license: PyShadow, PyMaKaizu, and PyZuma.

License updated on October 10, 2025, and applies collectively to all tools above.

Introduction

This document is the official Software License Agreement for PyShadow, PyMaKaizu, and PyZuma.
By accessing, downloading, or using the Tools, the User acknowledges and agrees to comply with all terms and conditions set forth below.
PyMaKaizu is the owner and retains full intellectual property rights over these Tools.

Our purpose is to provide protection against cracking and reverse engineering attacks. We aim to make it harder and more time-consuming for attackers to compromise your source code.
However, no protection is perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Our system only increases the difficulty for attackers.
Additionally, we monitor your code’s behavior — if signs of malware, keyloggers, or similar malicious activities are detected, we will immediately block the associated tool and terminate service.
We do not accept appeals or reinstate support for violators.

What We Protect

Prevention of network monitoring and custom-made network inspection tools.

Blocking popular tools such as httptoolkit, mitm, httpproxy, httpdebugging, etc.

Prevention of dynamic and static reverse engineering tools such as FRIDA, DECOMPILE6, UNCOMPILE3, GDB, DEBUGGING, etc.

Protection against both dynamic and static analysis tools.

Continuous process and network behavior monitoring to prevent hooking.

Prevention of low-level and high-level hooking, but not guaranteed against OS or Kernel-level hooks.

Prevention of software cracking attempts.

Blocking of fake certificates including CA, CC, SC, CSC, EC, DSC, EV, OV, DV, etc.

Notices

Execution Time
Code execution time may increase significantly due to verification and re-signing processes.
We cannot guarantee the same performance as the original unprotected code.

Violation Reporting
If you find any tool encrypted with our official encryptor showing signs of malware, virus, trojan, keylogger, etc., please report it immediately via Telegram: junidokai.
Include the enc_id in your report so we can disable the malicious tool.
Evidence is required to prove that the tool is harmful to avoid false removals.
Only officially encrypted tools (ENC) with our signature are eligible for removal requests; OBF versions are not supported.

Safety Assurance
Our behavior scanning system does not collect your data or source code.
It only detects whether your program sends suspicious data to external servers (e.g., keylogging).
We do not collect or store any of your code or data.
