By accessing, downloading or using the Tools, the User is deemed to have accepted and agreed to comply with all terms and conditions set out below. **PyMaKaizu** is the Owner and retains all intellectual property rights to these Tools.
- What we do is provide a solution to protect your source code from being attacked to cause **cracking**, **reverse engineering**. We provide a solution to protect your source code from unnecessary dangerous threats, however there is no perfect solution to help your source code avoid the risk of **'Hack'**, we only increase the cost and time for attackers to make it difficult for attackers. Again, there is no solution that provides complete protection. In addition, we have a mechanism to monitor your code's behavior. If there are signs of **malware**, **keylog**, **etc.**, we will immediately stop and will not tolerate these behaviors. We do not accept protests and refuse to provide protection services.

### What we protect
- Prevent **"network"** tracking and custom tools for **"network"** tracking.
- Prevent popular software such as **'httptoolkit'**, **'mitm'**, **'httpproxy'**, **httpdebugging**.
- Prevent dynamic and static reverse engineering tools such as: **'FRIDA'**, **'DECOMPILE6'**, **'UNCOMPILE3'**, **'GDB'**, **'DEBUGGING'**, etc.
- Prevent dynamic analysis and static analysis using custom tools.
- Monitor network process environment behavior, continuously monitor to prevent hooks.
- Prevent **hooks** at low and high levels, however, if **hooked** at the **OS**, **Kernel** level, we cannot guarantee that these hook levels will be successfully blocked.
- Prevent things related to **crack**.
- Prevent fake certificates **CA**, **CC**, **SC**, **CSC**, **EC**, **DSC**, **EV**, **OV**, **DV**.
