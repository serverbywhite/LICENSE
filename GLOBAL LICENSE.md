# PyMaKaizu License v5.7.1 (Non-Commercial Use)
## Foreword
- This document is the License to Use the Software **Pyshadow**, **PyMaKaizu**, **PyZuma**. By accessing, downloading or using the Tools, the User is deemed to have accepted and agreed to comply with all terms and conditions set out below. **PyMaKaizu** is the Owner and retains all intellectual property rights to these Tools.
- What we do is provide a solution to protect your source code from being attacked to cause **cracking**, **reverse engineering**. We provide a solution to protect your source code from unnecessary dangerous threats, however there is no perfect solution to help your source code avoid the risk of **'Hack'**, we only increase the cost and time for attackers to make it difficult for attackers. Again, there is no solution that provides complete protection. In addition, we have a mechanism to monitor your code's behavior. If there are signs of **malware**, **keylog**, **etc.**, we will immediately stop and will not tolerate these behaviors. We do not accept protests and refuse to provide protection services.

### What we protect
- Prevent **"network"** tracking and custom tools for **"network"** tracking.
- Prevent popular software such as **'httptoolkit'**, **'mitm'**, **'httpproxy'**, **httpdebugging**.
- Prevent dynamic and static reverse engineering tools such as: **'FRIDA'**, **'DECOMPILE6'**, **'UNCOMPILE3'**, **'GDB'**, **'DEBUGGING'**, etc.
- Prevent dynamic analysis and static analysis using custom tools.
- Monitor network process environment behavior, continuously monitor to prevent hooks.
- Prevent **hooks** at low and high levels, however, if **hooked** at the **OS**, **Kernel** level, we cannot guarantee that these hook levels will be successfully blocked.
- Prevent things related to **crack**.
- Prevent fake certificates **CA**, **CC**, **SC**, **CSC**, **EC**, **DSC**, **EV**, **OV**, **DV**.

### Attention
1. **Code Execution Time**
 - The execution time of the code may increase significantly because of the need to verify and re-sign quite a lot of things, so if you need an encryption with the same execution time as the original code, we cannot guarantee this to you.
2. **Report Violation**
 - If you find any Tools encrypted with our Encryption Tool that show signs of **Malware**, **Virus**, **Trojan**, **Keylog**, etc., please notify us immediately via Telegram: junidokai, when reporting, include enc_id so we can disable these harmful tools. Note that if possible, please prove that the Tools are harmful so that they are not deleted without reason for the Devs and only Encryption Tools (**ENC**) with our name will be accepted for deletion requests, while **OBF** will not be supported.
